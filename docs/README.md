# Project Documentation

This folder must contain architecture diagrams, API specs, deployment instructions and the deliverables required by the sprint (video script, canvas, cronogram).

Structure suggestions:
- docs/architecture/
- docs/diagrams/
- docs/specs/
- docs/decisions/
- docs/video/
- docs/checklist_final.md

Add files progressively as you prepare the final submission.
